# Playgrounds for [apollo-ios](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios)

The playgrounds in this project cover the following features of apollo-ios and GraphQL:
- Queries, the most basic GraphQL operation
- Mutations, used to change a piece of information on the server
- Subscriptions, use a websocket connection to subscribe to updates to a particular query
- SQLite caching, setting up an Apollo client with a SQLite cache
- Custom scalars, define your own scalar types based on existing GraphQL scalar types

_This project and the playgrounds work best with Xcode 13._
